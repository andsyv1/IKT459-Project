# IKT459-Project

Project objective: Classify humidity in thermal images
Project code framework: Pytorch
Project num classes: 22
Problem statement: Compare performance metricies from CNN models made with state of art models 

Diffrent codes used in the project and containing

- models.py are just a collection of diffrent state of art models like Densnet, Resnet18, VGG, Inception and Mobilenet

I have trained and tested my dataset on all the diffrent state of art models and found that Resnet18 give the best metrecies. 

Resnet18 have been later used to compare to the results from the other CNN models i have made

- Without Residual blocks
- With Residual blocks
- With Residual blocks and an added Varians layer with a fullyconnected layer
